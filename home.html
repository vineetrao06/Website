        Hello!

        <p>
          My name is Vineet, and I'm a 14-year-old well-rounded, and versatile
          freshman. As of right now, I attend Prospect High School with a big
          passion for computer science. I have always been into problem-solving,
          and I love applying it in real-life scenarios -- which is the main
          reason why I am so engrossed with programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, sports have been a very significant part of me.
          Throughout my entire life, I have been a very athletic kid and have
          always had a decent level of physical prowess. Thus, I chose to pursue
          rowing, as it's a challenging and vigorous sport, perfect for me.
